    Shopify order items are now enforced for uniqueness per email,
    order, and SKU. The previous unique_together model property did
    not produce the desired effect; a UniqueConstraint declaration
    does. This means that the minimum required Django release is now
    2.2, which is the release that added proper constraints support.
